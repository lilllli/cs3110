The problem set was interesting and a good test of our knowledge of Async.
One area of concern in our implementation was the specific cases in which exceptions were to be raised.
In some cases, we were forced to make uncertain decisions about which to raise and at what points in our code.
In this regard, the writeup was not very helpful in alleviating confusion regarding when certain failures were to be called.

Regarding the division of work, Lillian and Charles worked mostly on remoteController and worker, while Elaine worked on the applications and worker. Edward also worked on worker.
